# LLM - Agents

This project/script generates a brief summary and two interesting facts about a person using information scraped from their LinkedIn profile. It utilizes LangChain to format prompts and interact with OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model for text generation. The Proxycurl library is used to scrape LinkedIn data, which is then processed through a chain that combines the prompt template and the language model.

## Libraries

- LangChain: For managing the prompt template and integrating with OpenAI's language model.
- Proxycurl: For scraping LinkedIn profile data.
- dotenv: For securely handling environment variables.

## Classes

- Laboratory 01 - Content by prompt 
- Laboratory 02 - Summary with scrapping
- Laboratory 03 - Scrapping with Travily ⬅️
